Computer vision using Python with OpenCV, Flask, and HTML

## Parking Space Monitoring

This project uses OpenCV and Flask to monitor the occupancy of parking spaces through a video. It allows for the identification of available spaces and displays them on a web interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

You will also need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python flask numpy


## Project Structure

/your_project/
│
├── app.py                 # Main script that starts the Flask server
├── video.mp4              # Video to be processed (replace with your video)
├── vacancies.pkl          # Generated file containing the coordinates of the parking spaces
└── assets/                # Folder for static files (images, CSS, etc.)
    └── index.html        # HTML page to display the video

How to Use
Configure the Spaces:

Before running the project, you need to define the parking spaces in the video.
Run the code responsible for capturing the coordinates of the spaces and generating the vacancies.pkl file.
Run the Server:

After defining the spaces, you can start the Flask server. Execute the following command in the terminal:

python app.py

Access the Web Interface:

Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the interface.
The video will be processed, and available spaces will be displayed in real-time.
Features
Space Detection: The system detects occupied and free spaces based on the provided coordinates.
Web Interface: Displays a stream of the processed video with information about available spaces.
